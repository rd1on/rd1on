### ABOUT DATASET
The following table shows close approaches to the Earth by near-Earth objects (NEOs). Data are not available prior to
1900 A.D. nor after 2200 A.D. Data are further limited to encounters with reasonably low uncertainty.

#### Object primary designation
1. **Close-Approach (CA) Date:** Date and time (TDB) of closest Earth approach.
2. **CA Distance Nominal (au):** The most likely (Nominal) close-approach distance in astronomical units.
3. **CA Distance Minimum (au):** The minimum possible close-approach distance (Earth center to NEO center), in astronomical units.
4. **V relative (km/s):** Object velocity relative to Earth at close-approach.
5. **V infinity (km/s):** Object velocity relative to a massless Earth at close-approach.
6. **H (mag):** Asteroid absolute magnitude (in general, smaller H implies larger asteroid diameter). Undefined for comets.
7. **Diameter:** Diameter value when known or a range (min - max) estimated.
8. **Rarity:**
A measure of how infrequent the Earth close approach is for asteroids of the same size and larger:
    0 means an average frequency of 100 per year
    1 corresponds to roughly once a month
    2 to roughly once a year
    3 to roughly once a decade, etc.
    'n/a' means that a frequency estimate is not available. See note for details.

### EXTRA
- **One Astronomical Unit (au)** is approximately 150 million kilometers (see glossary for definition).
- **One Lunar Distance (LD)** is approximately 384,000 kilometers (see glossary for definition).
